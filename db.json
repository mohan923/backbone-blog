Instead of holding down the home button to launch your recent apps, SwipePad uses hotspots-corners and edges of your phone\u0027s screen-to trigger a new \u0027pad\u0027 (which is sorta like a dashboard of apps). Just drag your finger from a hotspot to the middle of the screen and the app switcher will pop up. It\u0027s like adding another layer to your phone."
